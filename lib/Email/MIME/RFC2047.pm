Email::MIME::RFC2047 - Correct handling of non-ASCII MIME headers

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Email::MIME;

 # create headers with non-ASCII chars

 use Email::MIME::RFC2047::Encoder;
 use Email::MIME::RFC2047::Mailbox;
  
 my $email = Email::MIME->create();
 my $encoder = Email::MIME::RFC2047::Encoder->new(
     encoding => 'utf-8',
     method   => 'Q',
 );
 
 $email->header_set(Subject => $encoder->encode_text($non_ascii_subject));

 my $to_address = Email::MIME::RFC2047::Mailbox->new(
    name    => $non_ascii_name,
    address => $email_address,
 );
 $email->header_set(To => $to_address->format($encoder));
 
 # parse headers with non-ASCII chars

 use Email::MIME::RFC2047::Decoder;

 my $email = Email::MIME->new($message);
 my $decoder = Email::MIME::RFC2047::Decoder->new();
 
 my $subject = $decoder->decode_text($email->header('Subject'));

 my $to_address = Email::MIME::RFC2047::AddressList->parse(
    $email->header('To')
 );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This set of modules tries to provide a correct and usable implementation of
RFC 2047 "MIME Part Three: Message Header Extensions for Non-ASCII Text". The
L<Encode> module also provides RFC 2047 encoding and decoding but it still
has some bugs regarding strict standards compatibility. More importantly,
a useful API should handle the different situations where RFC 2047
encoded headers are used. Section 5 of the RFC defines three use cases
for 'encoded-words':

(1) As a replacement of 'text' tokens, for example in a Subject header

(2) In comments, this case isn't handled by this module

(3) As a replacement for a 'word' entity within a 'phrase', for example,
one that precedes an address in a From, To, or Cc header

Especially, case (3) requires the handling of quoted strings as defined by
RFC 822. So the encoding and decoding modules provide separate methods for
the handling of text and phrases.

Since parsing and encoding of phrases makes up the bulk of handling address
headers like From, To or Cc, additional modules to handle these headers are
also provided.

See L<Email::MIME::RFC2047::Encoder> for encoding

See L<Email::MIME::RFC2047::Decoder> for decoding

See L<Email::MIME::RFC2047::Mailbox> for handling of Sender headers

See L<Email::MIME::RFC2047::MailboxList> for handling of From headers

See L<Email::MIME::RFC2047::AddressList> for handling of Reply-To, To, Cc
and Bcc headers

See L<Email::MIME::RFC2047::Group> for handling groups of mailboxes

=head1 TODO

Parsing of address headers is at an alpha stage at the moment.

Comments as defined by RFC 822 are not supported.
